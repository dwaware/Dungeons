Randomizing Algorithm for Creating Dundgeons!

My first Unity project (2017) is a tile scroll dungeon with an animated avatar.  The algorith was inspired by a blog post but the code is original. :)

Features:

* random room creation by seed
* carving and backtracking algorithm ensures the entire map is utilized
* every room can be reached by a series of doors and passages
* secret doors provide additional routes through the dungeon (they are visible on the minimap if you look carefully!!!)
* animated avatar
* shift-key increases movement rate / animation speed
* object serialization (save/load level)
*
